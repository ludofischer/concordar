Concordance
===========
A prototype of a graphical interface to build concordances for arbitrary texts.

The implementation is very rough around the edges, but works to a certain extent.

If you choose File > Import and select a text file, the left column will fill with the words contained in the text. If you then click on a word, in the right box you will see the contexts in which the word appears in the text.
