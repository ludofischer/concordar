Concordar is a graphical interface which can be used to build and display concordances for arbitrary texts.

Input files must be in plain text format; if they contain chracters outside the standard ASCII set, they must be encoded in UTF-8.

File > Open allows you to select a text to analyze. You can click on any word in the text to display a concordance for it. Alternatively, you can type the word in the box. You can choos the number of context words with by clicking on the 'Up' and 'Down' arrows or by typing in a number.
